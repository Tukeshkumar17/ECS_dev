## üì± How It Works

### Interface Overview

Your ECS_Dev has three buttons:

- **‚¨ÜÔ∏è UP** - Navigate up in menus / Scroll through messages
- **‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN** - Navigate down / Cycle through characters when typing
- **‚úì SELECT** - Confirm choices / Add character to message

The OLED display shows all menus, messages, and status information clearly, even in bright sunlight.

### Main Menu

After the splash screen, you'll see four options:

**1. üì§ Send Message**  
Compose and broadcast a text message to all nearby devices.

**2. üì• Inbox**  
View the last 20 received messages with sender ID and timestamp.

**3. üö® Emergency Broadcast**  
Send urgent alerts with predefined categories instantly.

**4. ‚öôÔ∏è Settings**  
Check battery status, device ID, and system information.

### Composing a Message

1. Select **"Send Message"** from the main menu
2. Use **DOWN** button to cycle through available characters:
   - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - Numbers (0-9)
   - Space and punctuation (. , ! ?)
   - Special option: **SEND** (to broadcast) or **DEL** (to delete last character)
3. Press **SELECT** to add the highlighted character
4. Navigate to **SEND** and press **SELECT** to broadcast
5. Your message transmits to all devices within range

**Character Set:** `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 .,!?`

### Emergency Broadcasting

For time-critical situations:

1. Select **"Broadcast"** from main menu
2. Choose emergency type using UP/DOWN:
   - üåä **FLOOD** - Water-related emergencies
   - üî• **FIRE** - Fire outbreaks or smoke
   - üè• **MEDICAL** - Medical emergencies or injuries
   - ‚öîÔ∏è **WAR/CONFLICT** - Security threats or violence
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **OTHER** - General urgent situations
3. Press **SELECT** to immediately broadcast to all devices

Emergency messages have priority routing and distinctive alerts on receiving devices.

### Understanding Message Flow

```
Your Device                Network                Other Devices
     ‚îÇ                        ‚îÇ                         ‚îÇ

```

Every ECS_Dev device automatically relays messages it receives, creating a mesh network that extends far beyond individual device range.

## üîã Power Management

### Battery Life Expectations

| Mode | Duration | Power Draw |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Active Communication** | 24-48 hours | ~120mA |
| **Receiving Only** | 48-72 hours | ~50mA |
| **Standby Mode** | 5-7 days | ~10mA |
| **Deep Sleep** | 2-3 weeks | <1mA |

### Maximizing Battery Life

‚úÖ **Auto-Sleep Feature:** Device automatically enters low-power mode after 5 minutes of inactivity  
‚úÖ **Wake on Button:** Press any button to instantly resume operation  
‚úÖ **Efficient Radio:** LoRa uses significantly less power than WiFi or cellular  
‚úÖ **OLED Display:** Only illuminates pixels as needed, saving energy

### Charging

Simply connect a Micro-USB cable to the TP4056 module. The LED on the charging module indicates status:
- **Red**: Charging in progress
- **Green**: Fully charged
- **Off**: No power connected

**Charge Time:** Approximately 3-4 hours for a depleted 2500mAh battery

---

## üì° Communication Range

### Real-World Performance

| Environment | Typical Range | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Open Fields** | 8-10 km | Clear line-of-sight, ideal conditions |
| **Suburban Areas** | 3-5 km | Houses and trees create obstacles |
| **Urban City** | 1-3 km | Buildings reflect and absorb signals |
| **Indoor** | 200-500 m | Walls significantly reduce range |
| **Mountains/Hills** | 15+ km | Elevation advantage extends range |

### Factors Affecting Range

**üå≤ Terrain & Obstacles**  
Trees, buildings, and hills block or reflect radio waves. Higher elevation dramatically improves range.

**üì∂ Antenna Quality**  
A proper antenna matched to your LoRa frequency is critical. The included wire antenna works, but upgrading to a tuned antenna can double your range.

**‚ö° Spreading Factor**  
ECS_Dev automatically adjusts spreading factor (SF7-SF12) based on signal quality. Higher SF means longer range but slower data transfer.

**üå¶Ô∏è Weather**  
Heavy rain slightly reduces range. Generally, weather has minimal impact on LoRa performance.

### Mesh Network Advantage

With multiple devices, messages relay automatically:
```
Device A ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 5km ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Device B ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 5km ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Device C

Effective Range: Device A can reach Device C (10km away) 
through Device B's relay, even though direct communication 
would be impossible!
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem: Device Won't Power On**
- ‚úì Check battery polarity (positive to positive, negative to negative)
- ‚úì Verify battery has charge (measure voltage - should be >3.0V)
- ‚úì Ensure TP4056 output is connected to ESP32 VIN pin
- ‚úì Try powering via USB cable directly

**Problem: Display Shows Nothing**
- ‚úì Verify I2C connections (SDA to GPIO21, SCL to GPIO22)
- ‚úì Check OLED receives power (3.3V and GND)
- ‚úì Confirm I2C address in code matches your display (usually 0x3C)
- ‚úì Test OLED separately with example sketch

**Problem: Can't Send or Receive Messages**
- ‚úì Ensure antenna is properly connected to LoRa module
- ‚úì Verify LoRa frequency matches between devices
- ‚úì Check SPI wiring between ESP32 and LoRa module

## üîí Security & Privacy Considerations

### Current Implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice**

ECS_Dev in its current form is designed for **emergency scenarios** where speed and reliability trump privacy. You should be aware of the following:

**No Encryption**  
Messages are transmitted as plain text. Anyone with a compatible LoRa receiver can intercept and read your communications.

**No Authentication**  
There's no verification of sender identity. Malicious actors could potentially spoof sender IDs or inject false messages.

**Open Broadcast**  
All messages are publicly broadcast to any device in range. Think of it like shouting in a crowded room - everyone can hear.

**No Message Tracking**  
The system doesn't confirm message delivery or provide read receipts.

### When Security Matters

For production deployments where privacy is critical, consider implementing:

**üîê AES-256 Encryption**  
Add the [AESLib library](https://github.com/DavyLandman/AESLib) for Arduino to encrypt message payloads.

**üîë Pre-Shared Keys**  
Devices in your network share a secret key for encryption/decryption.

**‚úçÔ∏è Digital Signatures**  
Use ECDSA signatures to verify message authenticity and prevent spoofing.

**üÜî Device Whitelisting**  
Only accept messages from known, trusted device IDs.

### Best Practices

- Don't transmit sensitive personal information
- Use code words or predetermined signals for critical information
- Assume anyone within range can intercept messages
- Test security additions thoroughly before deployment

---

## üì° Message Protocol

### Packet Structure

Every message follows a standardized format for compatibility:

```
[SENDER_ID]|[TIMESTAMP]|[MSG_TYPE]|[CONTENT]

Example Messages:
DEV_A3F2|1730140800|MSG|Water levels rising quickly
DEV_B7E1|1730140825|EMRG|MEDICAL|Injured person at coordinates
DEV_C2A9|1730140850|BCST|All clear, evacuation route open
```

### Message Types

| Code | Type | Purpose | Priority |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| `MSG` | Normal Message | Standard text communication | Low |
| `BCST` | Broadcast | Wide-area announcements | Medium |
| `EMRG` | Emergency | Urgent alerts requiring immediate attention | High |
| `ACK` | Acknowledgment | Message receipt confirmation | Low |

### Packet Flow
